An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to.\",\n","                    \"skills_required\": [\n","                        {\n","                            \"level\": \"Low\",\n","                            \"skill\": \"In order to discover unrestricted resources, the attacker does not need special tools or skills.
